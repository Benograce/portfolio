## `Process and Challenges`

First and Foremost, I set the goals and purpose of the portfolio and then planned the structure, content, and design elements of the website. After that, I created a rough layout of each page and determined the placement of key components such as Header, Navigation, Content, and Footer. Then, choosing the colour scheme for my portfolio was a tedious task.

During the design and development phase of the website, setting up Bootstrap 5 and implementing its components for a responsive layout was extremely challenging for me. To overcome this, I created a basic layout first and worked on the responsive layout first, to make sure it is optimized for all screen sizes. Then, I started with content creation, styling and optimized images. Apart from that, although using the Bootstrap 5 developer guide is useful for fast development of the website, in my case it was quite time-consuming because of the unfamiliarity with Bootstrap. I had no choice but to look for bootstrap documentation again and again. Bootstrap provides a good starting point, but fine-tuning may be required. After completion, I used animated Text and Images to enhance the overall user experience.

Last Step, I tested my website on various browsers and devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility. I Checked the responsiveness and made adjustments as needed.

## `What I've learned`
Creating a web portfolio provides an opportunity to learn and improve several areas, including technical, design, and problem-solving skills. I've improved my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, and sharpened my understanding of responsive design principles. Moreover, overcoming challenges related to responsiveness and browser compatibility enhances my problem-solving skills.
